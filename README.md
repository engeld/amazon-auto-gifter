# amazon-auto-gifter
Fetches Amazon Wishlists and gifts an item from the list once a month. The item is determined using different rocket-science conditions. FULLY AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS.

## Stack
Introducing:

- Ruby on Rails as *the framework*
- MySQL as *the database system*
- Unix-based System as *where the stuff eventually runs on* 

## Conditions
- Is it a good deal according to CamelCamelCamel?
  - **FIXME** Check if I can use the [Camel API](http://news.camelapi.com/)
- Is it cheaper than any deal on Toppreise.ch?
